# üé∞ Loops: Lucky Spin Casino Game

Welcome to **Chapter 4: Loops** in the Pythonly Beginner Series! In this fun mini-game, you'll build a **text-based casino-style spinner** using `for` and `while` loops ‚Äî and learn how to repeat actions, use random outcomes, and manage simple game logic.

---

## üìå What You'll Learn

* ‚úÖ How to use `for` and `while` loops
* ‚úÖ Using `break` and `continue`
* ‚úÖ Randomly choosing from lists
* ‚úÖ Looping with `range()`
* ‚úÖ Nesting loops for repeated logic
* ‚úÖ Handling user input and program flow
* ‚úÖ Building logic with conditionals

## üí° About the Project

In **Lucky Spin**, you:

* Start with coins (default: 10)
* Press Enter to spin the slot machine (each spin costs 1 coin)
* Symbols spin using `for` loop logic
* Match 2 or 3 symbols to win coins
* Play continues until you run out or choose to quit

---

## üß± Project Code (With Explanation)

```python
import random  # Importing random to generate random choices

# List of symbols that can appear in the slot
symbols = ["üçí", "üçã", "üçá", "üíé", "7Ô∏è‚É£"]
coins = 10  # Starting number of coins

print("üé∞ Welcome to Lucky Spin!")
print("You have", coins, "coins.")

# Main game loop: continues as long as you have coins
while coins > 0:
    play = input("\nPress Enter to spin or type 'q' to quit: ")
    if play.lower() == 'q':  # Exit condition
        break

    coins -= 1  # Deduct 1 coin per spin

    result = []  # Create an empty list to store the 3 results
    print("\nSpinning...")

    # Generate 3 random symbols using a for loop
    for i in range(3):
        symbol = random.choice(symbols)
        result.append(symbol)  # Add symbol to result list

    print(" ".join(result))  # Display all three symbols on one line

    # Evaluate the result using conditionals
    if result[0] == result[1] == result[2]:
        print("üéâ JACKPOT! You win 5 coins!")
        coins += 5
    elif result[0] == result[1] or result[1] == result[2] or result[0] == result[2]:
        print("‚ú® Nice! You win 2 coins!")
        coins += 2
    else:
        print("üí® No match. Try again!")

    print("Coins left:", coins)  # Show coin count after each round

print("\nThanks for playing Lucky Spin! üé∞")
```

## üß† Concepts in Action

| Concept           | Used In                                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `while` loop      | Keeps game running until coins = 0          |
| `for` loop        | Builds the spin result one symbol at a time |
| `range(3)`        | Loops 3 times to simulate a 3-slot reel     |
| `random.choice()` | Picks random emoji from `symbols` list      |
| Lists             | Store and display multiple values           |
| `break`           | Exit the game manually                      |
| Input validation  | Let players quit with 'q'                   |

## üéØ Bonus Challenges

* Add more symbols or emoji variations
* Add sound effects or slow reveal using `time.sleep()`
* Introduce difficulty levels (higher cost/higher reward)
* Track high score or coins earned in total
* Save game progress to a file (coming in a future chapter!)

## üí¨ Common Questions

**"Can I change the emojis?"**
Yes! Just swap out or add to the `symbols` list.

**"Why use **`** and not **`** for spinning?"**
We use `for i in range(3)` because we know we want exactly 3 spins.

**"What if I want more symbols or columns?"**
Update the `range()` and comparison logic ‚Äî great practice!

**"How do I slow down the spin for effect?"**
Use `time.sleep(0.5)` between each spin for more drama.
